Preheat oven to 350°F.
In a large bowl, mix flour, brown sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt.
In a medium bowl, mix applesauce, oil, vinegar, vanilla, and water.
Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients. Mix until just combined. Do not overmix. Batter will be thin.
Coat a 9-inch square pan with non-stick cooking spray. Pour batter into greased pan.
Bake on middle rack of oven until center is firm and a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. This will be about 30–40 minutes.
